# Python organizes codes using module. Python comes with many in
# built modules ready to use for e.g there is a math  module for
# mathematical related functions, re  module for regular expression
# and so on. But before you can use them you need to import them
# using the following syntax:

import math

# Now you can use module:
print(math.pi)
