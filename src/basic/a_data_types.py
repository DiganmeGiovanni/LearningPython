# - Python has 5 standard data types:
#    * Numbers
#    * String
#    * Tuple
#    * List
#    * Dictionary
#    * Boolean: True and False are boolean literals but another values are
#               also considered as false:
#               0, 0.0, (), [], {}, None


#
# In python you don't need to declare types of variables

x = 100                     # x is an integer
pi = 3.1416                 # pi is a float
name = 'Giovanni Aguirre'   # name is a string

# You can do multiple assignments
a = b = 50
