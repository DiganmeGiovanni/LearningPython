""" showing basic operations """
#
# Python has the different operators which allows
# you to carry out required calculations in your program.
#
# '+', '-' and '*' works as expected.
# '/'  (Float division): Divides and return result as floating
#      point number means it will always return fractional part.
#      For e.g: 3/2 = 1.5
# '//' (Integer division): perform integer division i.e it will
#      truncate the decimal part of the answer and return only
#      integer. For eg: 3//2 = 1
# '**' (Power): This operator helps to compute ab (a raise to the power of b).
# '%'  (Mod) also known as remainder or modulus operator.
#      This operator return remainder after division

print('Integer division of 3//2 = ', 3//2)
print('Float division of 3/2 = ', 3/2)
print('2^3 = ', 2**3)
